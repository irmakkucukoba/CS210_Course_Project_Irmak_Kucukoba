# CS210_Course_Project_Irmak_Kucukoba
This is the GitHub repository prepared for CS 210's Course Project.
In this repository you will find the codes that were prepared to calculate the correlation between my menstrual cycle phases and energy levels, using my step counts and Netflix watch time. Also you will find a detailed report of the project explaining each state and all my reasonings. This file is not the report itself :) There is a pdf file you need to look into. I hope you like it.
